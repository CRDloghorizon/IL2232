# IL2232 - Embedded Systems Design Project
## Project: Embedded Time-Series Analysis
### Authors: Jingyi Hu, Joshua Sadiq, Hengzhen Yuan, Yujie Chen

During 2023's course round of _IL2232_, the authors received a project of modeling and deploying four machine learning models unto the ESP32.
The purpose of this project was to create a proof-of-concept that edge computing can be a viable technique for time-series analysis, meaning deploying ML models unto embedded devices.

In the figure above, an overview of ML models on various platforms and in different level languages is given. [WIP]
The respective models - ARIMA, RNN, K-Means, and SOM - can be found in the subfolders with their own, respective instructions on how to run, compile, and deploy them.
