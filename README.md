# IL2232 - Embedded Systems Design Project
## Project: Embedded Time-Series Analysis
### Authors: Jingyi Hu, Joshua Sadiq, Hengzhen Yuan, Yujie Chen
### Supervisors: Prof. Zhonghai Lu, Doctoral Students Wenyao Zhu and Yizhi Chen

During 2023's course round of _IL2232_, the authors received a project of modeling and deploying four machine learning models unto the ESP32.
The purpose of this project was to create a proof-of-concept that edge computing can be a viable technique for time-series analysis, meaning deploying ML models unto embedded devices.
This project is based on the course _IL2233 - Embedded Intelligence_, where the concepts learned where then applied unto an embedded device.

**Our hope is that future students of aforementioned course can receive inspiration and insight into the principles taught in _IL2233_ by using this repository to run their own ML models on embedded devices!**

In the figure below, an overview of ML models on various platforms and in different level languages is given.

### For the interested student, detailed instructions and explanations on how to run the different models on your own (on PC and on embedded device) is given in the respective subfolders.
